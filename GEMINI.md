# Key Files

Each Markdown file in the subdirectories defines a single agent. The files follow a consistent structure:

- **Frontmatter**: Contains metadata about the agent, including its `name`, `description`, `color`, and the `tools` it uses.
- **Description**: A detailed description of the agent's role, responsibilities, and expertise.
- **Examples**: Usage examples for the agent.

For example, the `engineering/ai-engineer.md` file defines an agent that specializes in practical AI implementation, while the `design/ui-designer.md` file defines an agent for creating user interfaces.

# Usage
